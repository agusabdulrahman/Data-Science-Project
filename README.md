# Collection of Python notebooks for various machine learning, deep learning and analytics use cases

## Public Python Tutorials

Welcome to the GitHub tutorial directory of the blog on business use cases with python machine learning, deep learning and generative AI!

The files listed in this directory are all Jupyter notebook files.

Each file represents a separate Python project and is described in more detail in a blog post.

Some of the topics covered are:

- Time series forecasting for stock market prediction using recurrent neural networks
- Computer vision: image classification with convolutional neural networks
- Anomaly detection using random isolation forests
- Explorative analytics and visualization using different charts and tools, incl. heat maps and geographic maps
- Distributed computing with PySpark
- Generative AI, OpenAI/ChatGPT/GPT-X, prompt engineering
- Hyperparameter tuning using grid search, random search
- Recommender systems using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering
